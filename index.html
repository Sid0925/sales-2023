                <h2> Executive Insights Dashboard.</h2>
                <p >I have identified a real-world business problem that requires solving key questions and challenges related to revenue optimization and performance analysis. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, I have developed a powerful solution to address these concerns. The project focuses on understanding and improving revenue growth by analyzing factors such as geographic distribution of total revenue, high-performing product categories, sales performance across different time periods, proximity to planned revenue targets, top-selling products, revenue contributions from different countries, sales performance by product category, revenue trends over time, regions or cities with the highest sales growth, factors influencing profitability, impact of pricing on sales volume and revenue, effective sales channels or distribution methods, and profitable product lines or market segments. Through the implementation of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into these areas, enabling them to make informed decisions and take strategic actions to optimize revenue growth and drive business success.</p>

                            <h1>fact-dimension Data Model</h1>
                            
                           <p style="text-align: justify;"> In my project, I implemented a fact-dimension model to structure and organize the data for analysis. The fact-dimension model is a popular approach used in data modeling, particularly in business intelligence and data warehousing.

                            In this model, I designed a fact table that contains the primary business metrics or facts that are the focus of analysis. These facts could include measures like revenue, quantity sold, profit, or any other key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business.
                            
                            Alongside the fact table, I created dimension tables that provide additional context and descriptive attributes related to the facts. Dimension tables represent various aspects of the business, such as customers, products, time, locations, or any other relevant dimensions that help analyze and filter the facts.
                            
                            The dimension tables are linked to the fact table through relationships, typically using primary and foreign keys. This allows for easy and efficient querying and slicing and dicing of the data based on different dimensions and their hierarchies. By separating the facts and dimensions, the fact-dimension model promotes data integrity, scalability, and flexibility in analysis.
                            
                            By implementing the fact-dimension model, I was able to create a structured and organized data model that facilitated efficient data analysis and reporting. It allowed for granular analysis at different levels of detail, such as by customer, product, or time, providing valuable insights into the business's performance and enabling data-driven decision-making.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Calculated columns are an essential feature in data modeling, allowing for the creation of new derived columns based on existing data using formulas or expressions. These columns are computed during the data loading or transformation process and become part of the data model. By leveraging calculated columns, I was able to introduce additional metrics or calculations that were not directly available in the raw data. For example, I utilized calculated columns to determine the total revenue by multiplying the quantity sold with the price per unit.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a powerful formula language used in various analytical tools, including Power BI. It enables the definition of custom calculations, measures, and aggregations within the data model. With DAX, I could perform complex calculations and advanced data manipulations. By utilizing DAX functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and IF, I could aggregate data, apply business logic, and perform conditional calculations. For instance, I utilized the AVERAGE function in DAX to calculate the average order quantity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this guide, we'll explore some complex DAX expressions used to derive valuable insights and KPIs. I'll walk you through the logic and functions used in each measure and calculated column, explaining them in a step-by-step manner.</p>
<h2 class="yellow">Measures</h2>
<h3><span class="blue">1. Running Total</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Running Total measure calculates the cumulative revenue for the last 10 days from the maximum date in the data. Here's how we do it:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Find the Maximum Date:</b> Using the <code>MAX</code> function, we identify the most recent date in the 'Calendar_dimension' table.</li>
  <li><b>Calculate the Date Range:</b> The <code>DATESINPERIOD</code> function defines the last 10 days from the maximum date.</li>
  <li><b>Compute Running Total:</b> The <code>CALCULATE</code> function sums up the "Total Revenue" within the specified period, resulting in the Running Total measure.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="blue">2. TOP5 Products</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The TOP5 measure identifies the top 5 products based on their revenue. Here's the step-by-step process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Select All Products:</b> The <code>ALLSELECTED</code> function includes all selected products in the filter context.</li>
  <li><b>Sort by Revenue:</b> The <code>TOPN</code> function retrieves the top 5 products based on "Total Revenue" in descending order.</li>
  <li><b>Calculate Total Revenue:</b> The <code>CALCULATE</code> function computes the "Total Revenue" for the selected top 5 products, preserving existing filters with <code>KEEPFILTERS</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="blue">3. High Ticket Orders</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The High Ticket Orders measure calculates the number of orders with a price greater than the overall average price. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Filter Products:</b> The <code>FILTER</code> function filters products where the "ProductPrice" is greater than the "Overall Average price."</li>
  <li><b>Calculate Total Orders:</b> The <code>CALCULATE</code> function sums up the "Total Orders" for the filtered products.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="blue">4. Cumulative Total Revenue</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cumulative Total Revenue measure calculates the revenue up to a selected date. Here's the detailed explanation:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Select All Dates:</b> The <code>ALLSELECTED</code> function includes all selected dates in the filter context.</li>
  <li><b>Filter Dates:</b> The <code>FILTER</code> function includes dates less than or equal to the maximum selected date.</li>
  <li><b>Calculate Cumulative Revenue:</b> The <code>CALCULATE</code> function sums up the "Total Revenue" for the selected dates.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="yellow">Calculated Column Transformation</h2>
<h3><span class="blue">1. Customer Priority</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "Customer Priority" column classifies customers as "Priority" or "Standard" based on their annual income and whether they are parents. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Set Conditions:</b> The <code>AND</code> function checks if the annual income is greater than $100,000 and if the customer is a parent.</li>
  <li><b>Assign Priority:</b> The <code>IF</code> function sets the priority as "Priority" if the conditions are met, otherwise "Standard."</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="blue">2. Income Level</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "Income Level" column classifies customers into different income categories. Here's the detailed process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Set Income Ranges:</b> The <code>SWITCH</code> function checks the annual income and classifies it into "Very High," "High," "Average," or "Low."</li>
</ol>

        <li><strong>Data Type Conversion:</strong> Transformed various data types to maintain consistency, such as converting text to numbers or dates, ensuring proper alignment with the data model.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Identified and managed missing values through imputation or exclusion, depending on the business context and analysis requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Removing Duplicates:</strong> Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity and accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>String Manipulation:</strong> Performed advanced string operations to standardize text fields, including trimming whitespace, case conversion, and pattern matching.</li>
        <li><strong>Date and Time Processing:</strong> Cleaned and transformed date and time fields to enable time-based analysis, including handling different time zones and formats.</li>
        <li><strong>Column Transformation:</strong> Created calculated columns, pivoted and unpivoted tables, and performed data aggregation to align with the analytical needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditional Logic Implementation:</strong> Utilized conditional expressions to create new attributes and categorize data based on specific rules and criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Query Optimization:</strong> Designed queries with performance in mind, minimizing the load time and ensuring smooth data retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to catch and manage any anomalies or unexpected issues during the data transformation process.</li>
      </ul><br><br>
      <p>This comprehensive approach to data cleaning in Power Query not only ensured that the data was free from inconsistencies and errors but also laid a strong foundation for subsequent analysis and visualization in the Power BI dashboard.</p>


        <!-- Data Modeling -->
        <h3>Data Modeling and Structuring</h3>
        <p>Using a star schema, I designed a fact-dimension data model that facilitated efficient querying. Fact tables were used to store measurable data, while dimension tables provided context such as time periods, categories, and locations. I employed relationships and hierarchies to create a model that supports both high-level overviews and granular analysis.</p>
    
        <!-- Dashboard Creation -->
        <h3>Interactive Dashboard Creation</h3>
        <p>The dashboard was crafted with a blend of visuals like charts, graphs, and maps, driven by DAX calculations. I used slicers and bookmarks to enhance user interactivity, enabling users to explore data dynamically. Features like tooltips, drill-through, and custom visuals were implemented to provide a rich analytical experience.</p>
    
        <!-- User Collaboration -->
        <h3>Facilitating User Collaboration</h3>
        <p>I set up collaboration features within Power BI Service, enabling teams to co-author reports, share dashboards, and comment on visuals.
